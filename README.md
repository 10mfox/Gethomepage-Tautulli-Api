1. Create a `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  tautulli-manager:
    image: ghcr.io/10mfox/gethomepage-tautulli-api:latest
    container_name: tautulli-api-manager
    environment:
      - TAUTULLI_CUSTOM_PORT=3010
    ports:
      - "3010:3010"
    volumes:
      - ./config:/app/config
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Alternative configuration for Linux systems:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  tautulli-manager:
    image: ghcr.io/10mfox/gethomepage-tautulli-api:latest
    container_name: tautulli-api-manager
    user: "1000:1000"  # Replace with your user ID and group ID	
    environment:
      - TAUTULLI_CUSTOM_PORT=3010
    ports:
      - "3010:3010"
    volumes:

## Homepage Integration

Tautulli Unified Manager provides built-in configuration generation for the [Homepage](https://gethomepage.dev/) dashboard. The application automatically generates YAML configuration based on your configured sections and formatting preferences.

### Available Widgets
- **User Activity**: Display current watching users with status
- **Recently Added Media**: Show recently added content per section or combined
- **Media Count**: Display library statistics with formatted numbers

### Configuration Options
- Combine/split sections in Recently Added view
- Include/exclude count statistics in section views
- Use formatted/raw numbers for statistics
- Adjust the number of items displayed in each section

### Integrating Homepage CSS

To improve the appearance of Tautulli widgets in Homepage, you can add custom CSS to your Homepage installation:

1. Copy the CSS below to your Homepage installation's custom CSS file (typically located at `/app/config/custom.css`):

```css
/*================================== LIST STYLES ==================================*/
/* Recently Added/Activity Section */

/* Base styles (original) */
#list > div > div.relative.flex.flex-row.w-full.service-container > div > div {
  display: block;
  text-align: right;
}

#list > div > div.relative.flex.flex-row.w-full.service-container > div > div > div.flex.flex-row.text-right > div:nth-child(1) {
  text-align: right;
  margin-left: 0.5rem;
}

#list > div > div.relative.flex.flex-row.w-full.service-container > div > div > div.flex.flex-row.text-right > div:nth-child(2) {
  text-align: left;
  margin-left: auto;
}

/* Responsive styles for tablets and mobile devices */
@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
  /* Change flex direction for better mobile layout */
  #list > div > div.relative.flex.flex-row.w-full.service-container {
    flex-direction: column;
  }
  
  #list > div > div.relative.flex.flex-row.w-full.service-container > div > div {
    width: 100%;
    text-align: center;
    padding: 0.75rem 0;
  }
  
  #list > div > div.relative.flex.flex.row.text-right {
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    gap: 0.5rem;
  }
  
  #list > div > div.relative.flex.flex-row.w-full.service-container > div > div > div.flex.flex-row.text-right > div:nth-child(1) {
    text-align: center;
    margin-left: 0;
  }
  
  #list > div > div.relative.flex.flex-row.w-full.service-container > div > div > div.flex.flex-row.text-right > div:nth-child(2) {
    text-align: center;
    margin-left: 0;
  }
}

/* Extra small devices */
@media screen and (max-width: 480px) {
  #list > div > div.relative.flex.flex-row.w-full.service-container > div > div {
    padding: 0.5rem;
    font-size: 0.9rem; /* Slightly smaller font for very small screens */
  }
}
```

2. Restart your Homepage container to apply the CSS changes.

3. The CSS improves the display of list items in both the "Recently Added" and "Activity" sections, making them more responsive and mobile-friendly.
